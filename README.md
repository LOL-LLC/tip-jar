# TIP JAR

Core engineering on 0L has been an unfunded volunteer effort. Since about June 2019 the lead 0L developer, github user `0o-de-lally`, has contributed an estimated 5,060 man-hours exclusively to core protocol (last updated Sept 24th 2021). This effort was not compensated in any form.

Please consider donating to Infinite Game LLC's tip jar at the 0L address: `2B0E8325DEA5BE93D856CFDE2D0CBA12`

This address is marked as a “CommunityWallet” on chain. Funds will only be transferred to an 0L SlowWallet, which releases funds over time. Two-thirds of validators (by voting power) can vote to reject the outbound transactions.

If however you would prefer to donate stable coins, thank you so much for sending USDC to the Ethereum address: `0x7cB65bDA184EeeD0a62Ef083DfE9046f39fD2E16`

`<Annoying disclaimers>`


Sending anything to those wallets is a donation is voluntary and there should be no mistake: there is no service, coin, or privilege that comes from sending it.

Unfortunately that address wont be able to accept donations from any countries sanctioned by the USA. It's a wonderful sentiment, but please don't send since it may do more harm than good.

You're the best!
