# TIP JAR

Core engineering on 0L has been an unfunded volunteer effort. For example, since about June 2019 the lead 0L developer -- github user `0o-de-lally` -- has contributed an estimated 5,060 man-hours exclusively to core protocol (last updated Sept 24th 2021). This effort was not compensated in any form.

Please consider donating to Tip Jar at the 0L address: `2B0E8325DEA5BE93D856CFDE2D0CBA12`. When you set up an Autopay to this address you will be effectively your miner/validator with the volunteers. This wallet is managed by Infinite Game LLC.

This address is marked as a “CommunityWallet” on chain. Funds will only be transferred to an 0L SlowWallet, which releases funds over time. Two-thirds of validators (by voting power) can vote to reject the outbound transactions.
