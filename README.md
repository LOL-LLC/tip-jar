# TIP JAR

Core engineering on 0L has been an unfunded volunteer effort. In the past two and half years the lead 0L developer, github user `0o-de-lally`, has contributed an estimated 5,060 man-hours exclusively to core protocol (Sept 24th 2021). This effort was not compensated in any form.

Please consider donating to that developer's tip jar at address: 2B0E8325DEA5BE93D856CFDE2D0CBA12

This address is marked as a “CommunityWallet” on chain. Funds will only be transferred to an 0L SlowWallet, which releases funds over time. Two-thirds of validators (by voting power) can vote to reject the outbound transactions.
