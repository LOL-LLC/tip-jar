LOL will mark this address as a “CommunityWallet” on chain. By that we mean that we will only disburse funds after polling the community. Specifically, funds will be transferred to another Slow Wallet if 2/3 of validators in any epoch approve (by voting power). By the same vote mechanism, if a validator set decides to sunset this account for any reason, we will oblige.
